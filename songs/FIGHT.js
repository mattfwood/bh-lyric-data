(Bloodsucka!)\nWho gonna be the reason why I turn over? (Bloodsucka!)\nWho gonna be the gunner that I don't trust? (Bloodsucka!)\nWho gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped? (Bloodsucka!)\nWho gonna be the reason why I get high? (Bloodsucka!)\nWho gonna be the reason why I turn over? (Bloodsucka!)\nWho gonna be the gunner that I don't trust? (Bloodsucka!)\nWho gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped? (Bloodsucka!)\n\n[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]\nBum, bum, beat 'em, I would never wanna be 'em\nIf I catch 'em slipping, they gon' have to meet the eagle\nBum, bum, beat 'em, treat these niggas how I see 'em\nI don't need you either, send you right back where I seen ya\nBum, bum, beat 'em, I would never wanna be 'em\nIf I catch 'em slipping, they gon' have to meet the eagle\nBum, bum, beat 'em, treat these niggas how I see 'em\nI don't need you either, send you right back where I seen ya\n\n[Outro: Ameer Vann & Merlyn Wood]\nIn the game, in the game, in the game, in the game (bloodsucka!)\nIn the game, in the game, in the game, in the game (bloodsucka!)\nRunning thangs, running, run, running, run, running thangs (bloodsucka!)\nRunning thangs, running, run, running, run, running thangs\nIn the game, in the game, in the game, in the, in the\nIn the game, in the game, in the game, running thangs\nRunning thangs, running, run, running, run, running, run\nRunning thangs, running, run, running, run, running thangs"
