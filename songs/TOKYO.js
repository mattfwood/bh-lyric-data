module.exports = "[Verse 1: JOBA]\nToo many things I'd rather do different\nWoke up in a cold sweat, my emotions creepin'\nThree o'clock on the weekend, might as well sleep in\nStay down for the count when, she hit me with the \"what-ifs?\"\nAnd the \"what-whens?\" and the \"what-thens?\"\nWonder where my life went, living in the moment\nI been thinking 'bout my time spent, are the bills paid?\nIs it make or break? Will I find a way?\nAre my feelings changed? Will I be okay?\nI donâ€™t know, but what I do know is, life don't make sense\nIf you can't pay rent, so I place my bet\n\n[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]\nWhat got you shook on this Saturday?\nI take my L and I hold my place\nI split my L and I go away\nYou left a spell on my Saturday\nWhat got you shook on this Saturday?\nI take my L and I hold my place\nI split my L and I go away\nYou left a spell on my Saturday\n\n[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]\nI got cracks in my phone screen, the past fuck with my psyche\nSmoke weed and get high, please, went to school in the woodlands\nAnd that made niggas wanna fight me, so I don't take threats lightly\nTell them niggas come and find me, got his head in my eye view\nNew house off iTunes, new money, my perfume\nBig smile, in a good mood, I been running outta issues\nI ain't trippin' when the rent due, I ain't runnin' with a pistol\nI ain't locked in the system, taking care of my kin folk\n\n[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]\nTaking a book out the page of the graves\nI'm only human and I make mistakes\nChisel my flows so they can't liberate\nTalkin' the time as the pendulum sways\nI gotta face what I didn't create\nJust cause I can't relate, I don't debate\nI educate, illuminate\nOr we can't duplicate, no more moving the plates\nSecond chances feeling overrated\nUnappreciated so I bossed up\nMissed the time when we could share space\nBut it'll all be straight the day we cross up\nNothing better than some time with you\nBecause it's time I never wanna toss up\nLose myself inside of you, you find yourself in me\nI don't wanna be cautious\n\n[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]\nWhat got you shook on this Saturday?\nI take my L and I hold my place\nI split my L and I go away\nYou left a spell on my Saturday\nWhat got you shook on this Saturday?\nI take my L and I hold my place\nI split my L and I go away\nYou left a spell on my Saturday\n\n[Outro: JOBA]\nWhat got you shook?\nWhat got you shook?\nWhat got you shook?\nWhat got you shook?"
