Gomez]\nLosing my way, ohh\nSeeing your name, but I'll be fine, yeah\nYeah yeah yeah\nYeah yeah yeah\nYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\n(No worries) Losing my way, ohh\nDid I come again dressed out like a shame? Cloudy\nSeeing your name\nEyes are but a pain, roses in my veins, sorry\nBut I'll be fine, yeah (no worries)\nYeah yeah yeah (no worries)\nYeah yeah yeah (no worries)\nYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\n\n[Outro: Bearface]\nOoh, ooh, ooh\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh\nOh-oh-oh-ooh\nOh-oh-ooh\nOh-oh-oh-ooh"
