Is wide out, wide out\nKeep it deep inside my mind, it's off kilter, off kilter\nI told memory to vanish see, for that better pleasure, fuck\nTime machine gon' make it better, maybe better for ya\nI can't make this up, I can't take it back\nFeel like a monster, feel like a dead head zombie\nFeelings you don't want me, I ain't giving up\nYou should set if off, tell me \"time's up\"\nLet the water run, let my body run\n\n[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]\nWho got the feeling?\nTell me why I cry when I feel it, tell me why\nTell me why\nWho got the feeling?\nTell me why I cry when I feel it, tell me why\nTell me why\n\n[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]\nSince you wanna get high off a nigga\nI wanna die during sex or religion\nGod and pussy only know my intentions\nWaking on the tour bus then I'm swimming\nYou'd be hurtin' if you trust me, but you isn't\nHonestly, that's probably the right decision\nPrick up, listen, if you wanna get rich\nNo sleep, how real bad man wake up\n\n[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]\nI found false hope, in all kinda places\nHotel rooms and temporary feelings\nI put my clothes on, and try to check out\nI try to hide from the sun and let it set now\nDon’t let God see me, I got a lot of demons\nAnd I been sleeping with ‘em\nAnd now I’m tangled in the sheets\nAnd sinking deeper with ‘em\nI’m going deeper in it, find me drowning in it\n\n[Bridge: Dom McLennon]\nThey said do you make mistakes or do you make a change?\nOr do you draw the line for when it's better days?\nYou taste the wind for when it's cold and not to kill our flame\nI wonder who's to blame\nThey ask me \"Do you make mistakes or do you make a change?\nOr do you draw the line for when it's better days?\"\nWe taste the wind for when it's cold and not to kill our flame\nI wonder who's to blame\n\n[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]\nWho got the feeling?\nTell me why I cry when I feel it, tell me why\nTell me why\nWho got the feeling?\nTell me why I cry when I feel it, tell me why\nTell me why\n\n[Verse 5: Joba]\nEverything I have (is a mirror)\nAnd everywhere I stay (isn't solid ground)\nPeople don't make sense (to me anymore)\nHad it now, I guess\nTrying to figure it out\nTrying to figure it out\nI'm trying to figure it out\n\n[Outro: Kevin Abstract & bearface]\nI forgot my passport\nSure, all for a pretty sky\nI forgot my passport\nSure, all for a pretty sky\nI forgot my passport\nSure, all for a pretty sky\nI've got my passport\nSure, all for a pretty sky\n[?]\nTell me why\nTell me why"
