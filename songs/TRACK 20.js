Abstract]\nMy biggest issue is I can't have a kid\nOk, I'm lying, got some other fucking issues bitch\nI always wonder what it's like on the other side\nGuess I'll get to see it whenever my mother dies\nI'm sorry mom for making songs about the shit you done\nYou been the greatest no excuse for a shitty son\nMoved to progressive California, ay I switched up\nI was raised where some niggas getting lynched up\nIf you ain't playing ball or throwing cents up\nWas getting jumped on for trying to play dress-up\nI'm tired of seeing niggas that I hate copy me\nI'm tired of homophobic niggas that follow me\nThey're probably same type of niggas that'll swallow me\nI know you think that shit was weak but that was tongue-in-cheek\nPut the tongue to the cheek, pose for the pic\nY'all look the same, niggas getting desperate\nYou want some fucking love?\nYou want some Instagram likes?\nYou're posted in the club\nI'm in the hotel room on tour, man\nSet the stew up\nEverywhere I go man\nI liked Wayne when I was in the fucking sixth grade\nThat's why Ashlan keep the camera on me all day\nA young Spike Jonze, movies on my iPhone\nThis music shit shit is cool, wait to see what\n(Keep it rolling, keep it rolling)\n\n[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]\nYou gotta get your head in the building\nY'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me\nMy nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear em\nI

the silver grip my knuckles\nWhen they ask you who shot em\nNobody doing jail time\nNobody paying consequence\nSilence when it rest\nWords murder all time\nGot that shit offset\nNow my bitch upset\nYeah I creep upstream\nIma bury till they send me\nI'm a gun to the human\nI'm a psychopath\nI'm a menace, man, with no dentist plan after 27\nOffset, offset, I'm a scape rat\nI'm a mallrat with that palm sweat on my white tee\nI'm like sight see with my CC, yo CEO\nI need us, I need love, I need hope (aaa) to keep me going\nI need to keep them doors open\nI ain't talk unless the cash there\nWith denim and cashmere\nCrib in Japan\nSushi in my hand\nRecording everything\n[?]\nBlack everyday\n\n[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]\nYou gotta get your head in the building\nY'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me\nMy nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear him\nI ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing\nYou gotta get your head in the building\nY'all gotta gimme your

behind this bullshit\nI mean everything you do is a nusaince\nAnd you say you wanna ride with the shooters?\nIf that's true, forgive me if I'm wrong\nBut I'ma bet my life on it, you don't even own a gun\nWave hi as I stand outside (hi!)\nWith my short-shorts on\nYou sneak a picture, there's a shoobie on yo front lawn\nHit you on the head with my flip flop\nSpin in the air like I did that\nLaying low til I flip out, I'm a bit imbalanced, I know\n20-20 vision I'm watching\nYou built a career off of problems\nYou ain't ever deal with this toxic, you should be ashamed\nI see right through the facade\nYou must think everyone's blind\nI don't play into the lies\nI just thought you should know\n\n[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]\nYou gotta get your head in the building\nY'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me\nMy nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear him\nI ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing\nYou gotta get your head in the building\nY'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me\nMy nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear him\nI ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing"
