module.exports = "[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]\nDressed in the same shit I wore yesterday\nYeah, it's still fresh, never flexed clich√©s\nI never write a verse and repeat the same thing\nCause the sheen on my chains is my calling to fame\nMade in the projects, slave to my progress\nI only fuck a black girl if she wearing contacts\nYou ain't gotta talk you still blocked from my contacts\nShe hit me on my MySpace she ever wanna find me\nI'm way too fly to drive, too drunk to call a cab\nBut I still need a ride to fit a couple girls inside\nOh what am I to do? I rent an Uber for the week\nIt's just another whip on my back, and we don't pay no tax\nCause where I come from, ain't no body getting shot by the IRS\nThe trap ain't free, you better realize that\nBut imma get money, no tests on the desk\nFuck the SAT's, smoking Sunday's best\nFind me in the ground, only time I regress\nSix feet down, no I'm not there yet\nWon't you meet me in the grave? I got grass on deck\nSo a grave like a slaveship, candy colored spaceship\nSpace like a white girl but ride like a Lexus\nLeather with an accent, designed by Italians\nBut he ain't got medallions so maybe he a Mexican\nBut really what's the difference?\n\n[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]\nI don't know difference, mirror black and white like a pilgrim\nPlymouth landed on me like a kickflip\nY'all repress this, oppress this\nQuestion next is why my mention so menstrual?\nI be going ham on Ray street eating tofu\nLoiter at the wholefoods, sipping kombucha\nYeah I went green but the black will still do ya\nDamn, she used to be my number one, past tense\nPast time chillin, evolved into the villian\nSunday school friends\nIn search of second circumcisions\nNah, keep your opinions\nWe was mallrats just cheesin' for the pictures\nNow who can circumvent us?"
